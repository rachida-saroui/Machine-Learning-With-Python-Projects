# book-recommendation-knn
creating a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbor

Dataset:[Book-Crossings dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)

This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

After importing and cleaning the data, use NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. 

The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.
